# a# 🧠 AI/ML Learning Labs

This is my personal sandbox for learning and practicing AI/ML libraries and techniques. Here, I explore core Python libraries for data science, machine learning, and deep learning.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `numpy/`: Numerical operations and array math
- `pandas/`: Data wrangling and analysis
- `scikit-learn/`: Traditional ML models and workflows
- `pytorch/`: Deep learning and neural networks
- `projects/`: Mini-projects combining multiple tools
- `notes/`: Markdown or notebook-based learning notes

## 🚀 Goals

- Strengthen core AI/ML knowledge
- Document learning with clean, modular code
- Build real-world mini-projects
